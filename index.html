                The Grand Challenges (GC) program was designed in 2005 to stimulate and support transformative new ideas for global health
                and development â€“ ultimately new ideas to save and improve lives around the globe. With the GC program, the
                Gates Foundation sought to define and widely publicize compelling problems that would stimulate new innovators
                and creative new ideas.
                <br>To accomplish this, the GC program embraced a new approach to soliciting and selecting ideas that would permit
                the evaluation of a very large number of shorter applications, and in the ten years it has been active, has
                received over 40,000 proposals from over 190 countries. Since then, other funding partners have embraced
                a similar model of selection and grantmaking, and the impact of the over 1,300 projects funded is widely
                needed.

            <p>
                As described above the Grand Challenges Organization gives out grants to research projects that are trying to solve prevelant
                globath heath issues. However, due to a lack of information provided by grantees, it is difficult for the
                foundation to measure their impact. The Organization is looking for a way to be able to understand the impact
                their grants. The way to understand this impact is by finding articles about the projects the Organization
                funded to find out what came out of their research.

                Our solution brings the vastness of the web into an organized, searchable portal that will allow users to find and filter
                news articles related specifically to projects funded by the foundation. With stories and evidence of the
                value of these smaller grants, the Grand Challenges program will continue to receive funding and solve important
                global health issues.
